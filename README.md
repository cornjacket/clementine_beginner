Now the tutorial has been re-targeted as the voting poll basejump for fcc.

Running through the clementine beginner tutorial

This app has been customized to work on c9.io. The URL has been configured to work on my own account using port 8080. These items need to be verified for this app to correctly work.

This is a javascript version of the poll basejump. Currently it is able to add a poll with 2 options. The index page shows a list of all polls.
The profile page shows a list of the polls created only by the user.

There is no styling applied to this version, just base functionality.

I am leaving this version as-is for the time being to re-implement it in Angular. Angular should allow me to progress much faster than with
VanillaJs.
